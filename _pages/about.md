### Short Bio

Dr. Kaicheng Yu's research interests cover broader areas of computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, with special emphasis on building intelligent visual systems. He receives Westlake Star Award (Young Talent Program) in 2022, and Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship Europe in 2019, and has been recognized as an outstanding reviewer at ECCV2020 and CVPR2021. He publishes on top conference venues like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS, and journals like TPAMI. 
<!-- His works have been cited over 600 times, and one of his first-authored papers has been cited over 300 times and opens a new research direction in neural architecture search. After joining Alibaba as a senior applied research scientist on September 2021, he builds a research team with seven members, where five of those are PhD students from top universities in China, like Tsinghua and Peking University, and is in charge of five Alibaba Innovation Research~(AIR) projects.  -->

His ultimate research goal is to build a system that incorporates automatic machine learning to evolve with a human-in-the-loop feedback to achieve generic 3D perception across multi-modalities for robotic vision systems. Specifically, his works include:
- Towards robust 3D perception in autonomous driving scenarios in  Bird's Eye View fashion and cross-modality 3D generation;
- Cross modalities of 3D data generation in the wild, including camera and LiDAR sensors;
- Automatically improves the performance of neural architectures, including neural architecture search, active learning, and lifelong learning.
