### Short Bio

Dr. Kaicheng Yu is an Assistant Professor at Westlake University, where he founded the Autonomous Intelligence Lab (AutoLab) in 2023. Prior to his academic appointment, he conducted research at Intel Labs and Alibaba DAMO Academy. He was awarded the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship Europe in 2019. Dr. Yu completed his Bachelor's degree with First Class Honour from the University of Hong Kong in 2016 and earned his Ph.D. from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in 2021. His research has been published in leading computer vision and machine learning venues, including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS, as well as prominent journals such as IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI). His research focuses on developing next-generation AI systems for autonomous intelligence, with applications on autonomous driving and AI for Science. Additionally, Dr. Yu serves as the Co-founder and Chief Scientist of [KMind](kmind.com), a company developing agent-enhanced internet solutions to improve user efficiency through personalized local search. 
<!-- His works have been cited over 600 times, and one of his first-authored papers has been cited over 300 times and opens a new research direction in neural architecture search. After joining Alibaba as a senior applied research scientist on September 2021, he builds a research team with seven members, where five of those are PhD students from top universities in China, like Tsinghua and Peking University, and is in charge of five Alibaba Innovation Research~(AIR) projects.  -->

His ultimate research goal is to build a system that incorporates automatic machine learning to evolve with a human-in-the-loop feedback to achieve generic 3D perception across multi-modalities for robotic vision systems. Specifically, his works include:
- Towards robust 3D perception & action in autonomous driving scenarios in  Bird's Eye View fashion and cross-modality 3D generation;
- Cross modalities of 3D data generation in the wild, including camera and LiDAR sensors;
- Automatically improves the performance of neural architectures, including neural architecture search, active learning, and lifelong learning.
